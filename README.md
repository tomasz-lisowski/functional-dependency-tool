# Functional Dependency Tool
**Features:**
- Compute attribute closure.
- Compute all possible attributes closures.
- Compute primary and super keys.
- Check if FDs are in BCNF or 3NF.
- Compute the determinant for a set of attributes.

**Note:** Memory allocations are assumed to never fail and the tool is designed in such a way that memory is not freed explicitly for the most part, rather it relies on the OS to do it instead.
